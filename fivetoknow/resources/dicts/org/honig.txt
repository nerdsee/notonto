#The Project Gutenberg Etext of Mr Honey's Beginner Dictionary
#(German-English)
#******This file should be named 8bgde10.txt or 8bgde10.zip******
#
#Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 8bgde11.txt
#VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 8bgde10a.txt
#
#This Etext prepared by Michael Pullen,
#globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com.
#
#We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
#of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
#Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
#the official publication date.
#
#Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
#midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
#The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
#Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
#preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
#and editing by those who wish to do so.
#
#Most people start at our sites at:
#http://gutenberg.net
#http://promo.net/pg
#
#
#Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
#can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
#also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
#indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
#announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

#as it appears in our Newsletters.

#
#Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
#
#We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
#time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
#to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
#searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
#projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
#per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
#million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
#files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
#If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
#should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.
#
#The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
#Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
#This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
#which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
#
#At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
#of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
#manage to get some real funding.
#
#
#The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
#to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.
#

#We need your donations more than ever!

#History and Philosophy
#
#Die Anf‰nge dieses Wˆrterbuches gehen zur¸ck in die Zeit als England
#der Europ‰ischen Gemeinschaft beitreten wollte.
#
#In einer Gemeinschaftsarbeit von BBC, British Council, dem Dept. of
#Educ. und der OUP machte man sich Gedanken, wie man dem
#F¸hrungsnachwuchs auf dem Kontinent die englische Wirtschaftssprache
#beibringen kˆnnte.
#
#Als einer der wenigen Dozenten, die damals in London
#Wirtschaftsenglisch lehrten, kam ich in Kontakt mit dem Projekt.
#
#Da ich mich zu jener Zeit f¸r eine Karriere in der Daten-verarbeitung
#oder als Hochschullehrer f¸r Wirtschaftsenglisch entscheiden musste,
#w‰hlte ich eine Kombination von beidem.
#
#Als Dozent der FH machte ich den Einsatz von Multimedia in der
#Vermittlung von brauchbarem Wirtschaftsenglisch zu meiner Aufgabe.
#
#F¸r die Anforderungen verschiedener Seminare, Schwerpunkte,
#Zielgruppen entstanden aus der praktischen Arbeit die Wortlisten und
#Wˆrterb¸cher.
#
#Aufgewachsen und geschult in der praktischen Denkweise von A.S.
#Hornby, einem Fellow des University College London, legte ich
#besonderen Wert auf die hohe Zahl mˆglichst dienlicher
#Anwendungsbeispiele.
#
#Die indizierten sequentiellen Wortlisten der Kompaktversionen,
#--anders und meines Erachtens noch viel besser--die groﬂen
#sequentiellen Wortlisten der CD-ROM-Versionen mit der stufenweisen
#bis globalen Suche in den Wort- und Beispiellisten zunehmenden
#Umfangs, ermˆglichen eine optimale sprachliche Orientierung in einem
#umfangreichen wirtschaftlichen Sprachsschatz.
#
#Dabei sehe ich neue Wege und Mˆglichkeiten des Erwerbs und des
#Umgangs mit der Fachsprache.
#
#Wahrscheinlich bietet sich hier weit mehr als sich im ersten Eindruck
#erahnen l‰ﬂt.  Spielerisch sollte es mˆglich sein, leichter,
#schneller und intensiver zu lernen.
#
#Durch die Vielzahl der Assoziationen d¸rfte sich schneller als bisher
#eine gehobene fachsprachliche Kompetenz entwickeln.

#******This file should be named 8code10.txt or 8code10.zip******

#Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 8code11.txt

#This Etext prepared by Michael Pullen,

#
#We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
#of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
#Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
#the official publication date.
#
#Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
#midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
#The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
#Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
#preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
#and editing by those who wish to do so.
#
#Most people start at our sites at:

#http://promo.net/pg
#
#
#Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
#can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
#also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
#indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
#announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

#Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
#as it appears in our Newsletters.
#
#
#Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
#
#We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
#time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
#to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
#searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
#projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
#per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
#million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
#files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
#If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
#should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.
#
#The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
#Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
#This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
#which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
#
#At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
#of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
#manage to get some real funding.
#
#
#The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
#to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

#In the 1970s Winfried Honig, known as Mr Honey, started compiling and
#computerizing English/German dictionaries, partly to provide his
#colleagues and students with samples of the language of business,
#partly to collect convincing material for his State Department of
#Education to illustrate the need for special dictionaries covering
#the special language used in different branches of the industry.
#
#In 1997 Mr Honey began to feed his wordlists into the LEO Online
#Dictionary http://dict.leo.org of the Technische Universit‰t M¸nchen,
#and in 2000 into the DicData Online Dictionary http://www.dicdata.de

#History and Philosophy
#
#Die Anf‰nge dieses Wˆrterbuches gehen zur¸ck in die Zeit als England
#der Europ‰ischen Gemeinschaft beitreten wollte.
#
#In einer Gemeinschaftsarbeit von BBC, British Council, dem Dept. of
#Educ. und der OUP machte man sich Gedanken, wie man dem
#F¸hrungsnachwuchs auf dem Kontinent die englische Wirtschaftssprache
#beibringen kˆnnte.
#
#Als einer der wenigen Dozenten, die damals in London
#Wirtschaftsenglisch lehrten, kam ich in Kontakt mit dem Projekt.
#
#Da ich mich zu jener Zeit f¸r eine Karriere in der Daten-verarbeitung
#oder als Hochschullehrer f¸r Wirtschaftsenglisch entscheiden musste,
#w‰hlte ich eine Kombination von beidem.
#
#Als Dozent der FH machte ich den Einsatz von Multimedia in der
#Vermittlung von brauchbarem Wirtschaftsenglisch zu meiner Aufgabe.
#
#F¸r die Anforderungen verschiedener Seminare, Schwerpunkte,
#Zielgruppen entstanden aus der praktischen Arbeit die Wortlisten und
#Wˆrterb¸cher.
#
#Aufgewachsen und geschult in der praktischen Denkweise von A.S.
#Hornby, einem Fellow des University College London, legte ich
#besonderen Wert auf die hohe Zahl mˆglichst dienlicher
#Anwendungsbeispiele.
#
#Die indizierten sequentiellen Wortlisten der Kompaktversionen,
#--anders und meines Erachtens noch viel besser--die groﬂen
#sequentiellen Wortlisten der CD-ROM-Versionen mit der stufenweisen
#bis globalen Suche in den Wort- und Beispiellisten zunehmenden
#Umfangs, ermˆglichen eine optimale sprachliche Orientierung in einem
#umfangreichen wirtschaftlichen Sprachsschatz.
#
#Dabei sehe ich neue Wege und Mˆglichkeiten des Erwerbs und des
#Umgangs mit der Fachsprache.
#
#Wahrscheinlich bietet sich hier weit mehr als sich im ersten Eindruck
#erahnen l‰¬ﬂt.  Spielerisch sollte es mˆglich sein, leichter,
#schneller und intensiver zu lernen.
#
#Durch die Vielzahl der Assoziationen d¸rfte sich schneller als bisher
#eine gehobene fachsprachliche Kompetenz entwickeln.

#This Etext prepared by Michael Pullen,

#
#We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance

#Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
#the official publication date.
#
#Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
#midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
#The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
#Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
#preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
#and editing by those who wish to do so.
#
#Most people start at our sites at:

#
#
#Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
#can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
#also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
#indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
#announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

#Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
#as it appears in our Newsletters.
#
#
#Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
#
#We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
#time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
#to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
#searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
#projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
#per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
#million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
#files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
#If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
#should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.
#
#The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
#Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
#This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
#which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
#
#At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
#of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
#manage to get some real funding.
#
#
#The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
#to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

#In the 1970s Winfried Honig, known as Mr Honey, started compiling and
#computerizing English/German dictionaries, partly to provide his
#colleagues and students with samples of the language of business,
#partly to collect convincing material for his State Department of
#Education to illustrate the need for special dictionaries covering
#the special language used in different branches of the industry.
#
#In 1997 Mr Honey began to feed his wordlists into the LEO Online
#Dictionary http://dict.leo.org of the Technische Universit‰t M¸nchen,
#and in 2000 into the DicData Online Dictionary http://www.dicdata.de
#
#While more than 500.000 daily visitors use the online versions,

#History and Philosophy
#
#Die Anf‰nge dieses Wˆrterbuches gehen zur¸ck in die Zeit als England
#der Europ‰ischen Gemeinschaft beitreten wollte.
#
#In einer Gemeinschaftsarbeit von BBC, British Council, dem Dept. of
#Educ. und der OUP machte man sich Gedanken, wie man dem
#F¸hrungsnachwuchs auf dem Kontinent die englische Wirtschaftssprache
#beibringen kˆnnte.
#
#Als einer der wenigen Dozenten, die damals in London
#Wirtschaftsenglisch lehrten, kam ich in Kontakt mit dem Projekt.
#
#Da ich mich zu jener Zeit f¸r eine Karriere in der Daten-verarbeitung
#oder als Hochschullehrer f¸r Wirtschaftsenglisch entscheiden musste,
#w‰hlte ich eine Kombination von beidem.
#
#Als Dozent der FH machte ich den Einsatz von Multimedia in der
#Vermittlung von brauchbarem Wirtschaftsenglisch zu meiner Aufgabe.
#
#F¸r die Anforderungen verschiedener Seminare, Schwerpunkte,
#Zielgruppen entstanden aus der praktischen Arbeit die Wortlisten und
#Wˆrterb¸cher.
#
#Aufgewachsen und geschult in der praktischen Denkweise von A.S.
#Hornby, einem Fellow des University College London, legte ich
#besonderen Wert auf die hohe Zahl mˆglichst dienlicher
#Anwendungsbeispiele.
#
#Die indizierten sequentiellen Wortlisten der Kompaktversionen,
#--anders und meines Erachtens noch viel besser--die groﬂen
#sequentiellen Wortlisten der CD-ROM-Versionen mit der stufenweisen
#bis globalen Suche in den Wort- und Beispiellisten zunehmenden
#Umfangs, ermˆglichen eine optimale sprachliche Orientierung in einem
#umfangreichen wirtschaftlichen Sprachsschatz.
#
#Dabei sehe ich neue Wege und Mˆglichkeiten des Erwerbs und des
#Umgangs mit der Fachsprache.
#
#Wahrscheinlich bietet sich hier weit mehr als sich im ersten Eindruck
#erahnen l‰¬ﬂt.  Spielerisch sollte es mˆglich sein, leichter,
#schneller und intensiver zu lernen.
#
#Durch die Vielzahl der Assoziationen d¸rfte sich schneller als bisher
#eine gehobene fachsprachliche Kompetenz entwickeln.

#We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance

#
#Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
#midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
#The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
#Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
#preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
#and editing by those who wish to do so.

#
#Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
#can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
#also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
#indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
#announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

#Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
#
#We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
#time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
#to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
#searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
#projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
#per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
#million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
#files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
#If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
#should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.
#
#The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
#Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
#This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
#which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
#
#At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
#of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
#manage to get some real funding.
#
#
#The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
#to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

#In the 1970s Winfried Honig, known as Mr Honey, started compiling and
#computerizing English/German dictionaries, partly to provide his
#colleagues and students with samples of the language of business,
#partly to collect convincing material for his State Department of
#Education to illustrate the need for special dictionaries covering
#the special language used in different branches of the industry.
#
#In 1997 Mr Honey began to feed his wordlists into the LEO Online
#Dictionary http://dict.leo.org of the Technische Universit‰t M¸nchen,
#and in 2000 into the DicData Online Dictionary http://www.dicdata.de
#

#History and Philosophy
#
#Die Anf‰nge dieses Wˆrterbuches gehen zur¸ck in die Zeit als England
#der Europ‰ischen Gemeinschaft beitreten wollte.
#
#In einer Gemeinschaftsarbeit von BBC, British Council, dem Dept. of
#Educ. und der OUP machte man sich Gedanken, wie man dem
#F¸hrungsnachwuchs auf dem Kontinent die englische Wirtschaftssprache
#beibringen kˆnnte.
#
#Als einer der wenigen Dozenten, die damals in London
#Wirtschaftsenglisch lehrten, kam ich in Kontakt mit dem Projekt.
#
#Da ich mich zu jener Zeit f¸r eine Karriere in der Daten-verarbeitung
#oder als Hochschullehrer f¸r Wirtschaftsenglisch entscheiden musste,
#w‰hlte ich eine Kombination von beidem.
#
#Als Dozent der FH machte ich den Einsatz von Multimedia in der
#Vermittlung von brauchbarem Wirtschaftsenglisch zu meiner Aufgabe.
#
#F¸r die Anforderungen verschiedener Seminare, Schwerpunkte,
#Zielgruppen entstanden aus der praktischen Arbeit die Wortlisten und
#Wˆrterb¸cher.
#
#Aufgewachsen und geschult in der praktischen Denkweise von A.S.
#Hornby, einem Fellow des University College London, legte ich
#besonderen Wert auf die hohe Zahl mˆglichst dienlicher
#Anwendungsbeispiele.
#
#Die indizierten sequentiellen Wortlisten der Kompaktversionen,
#--anders und meines Erachtens noch viel besser--die groﬂen
#sequentiellen Wortlisten der CD-ROM-Versionen mit der stufenweisen
#bis globalen Suche in den Wort- und Beispiellisten zunehmenden
#Umfangs, ermˆglichen eine optimale sprachliche Orientierung in einem
#umfangreichen wirtschaftlichen Sprachsschatz.
#
#Dabei sehe ich neue Wege und Mˆglichkeiten des Erwerbs und des
#Umgangs mit der Fachsprache.
#
#Wahrscheinlich bietet sich hier weit mehr als sich im ersten Eindruck
#erahnen l‰ﬂt.  Spielerisch sollte es mˆglich sein, leichter,
#schneller und intensiver zu lernen.
#
#Durch die Vielzahl der Assoziationen d¸rfte sich schneller als bisher
#eine gehobene fachsprachliche Kompetenz entwickeln.

#This Etext prepared by Michael Pullen,

#
#We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
#of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
#Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
#the official publication date.
#
#Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
#midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
#The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
#Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
#preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
#and editing by those who wish to do so.
#
#Most people start at our sites at:

#
#
#Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
#can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
#also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
#indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
#announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

#as it appears in our Newsletters.

#
#Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
#
#We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
#time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
#to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
#searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
#projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
#per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
#million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
#files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
#If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
#should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.
#
#The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
#Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
#This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
#which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
#
#At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
#of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
#manage to get some real funding.
#
#
#The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
#to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

#History and Philosophy
#
#Die Anf‰nge dieses Wˆrterbuches gehen zur¸ck in die Zeit als England
#der Europ‰ischen Gemeinschaft beitreten wollte.
#
#In einer Gemeinschaftsarbeit von BBC, British Council, dem Dept. of
#Educ. und der OUP machte man sich Gedanken, wie man dem
#F¸hrungsnachwuchs auf dem Kontinent die englische Wirtschaftssprache
#beibringen kˆnnte.
#
#Als einer der wenigen Dozenten, die damals in London
#Wirtschaftsenglisch lehrten, kam ich in Kontakt mit dem Projekt.
#
#Da ich mich zu jener Zeit f¸r eine Karriere in der Daten-verarbeitung
#oder als Hochschullehrer f¸r Wirtschaftsenglisch entscheiden musste,
#w‰hlte ich eine Kombination von beidem.
#
#Als Dozent der FH machte ich den Einsatz von Multimedia in der
#Vermittlung von brauchbarem Wirtschaftsenglisch zu meiner Aufgabe.
#
#F¸r die Anforderungen verschiedener Seminare, Schwerpunkte,
#Zielgruppen entstanden aus der praktischen Arbeit die Wortlisten und
#Wˆrterb¸cher.
#
#Aufgewachsen und geschult in der praktischen Denkweise von A.S.
#Hornby, einem Fellow des University College London, legte ich
#besonderen Wert auf die hohe Zahl mˆglichst dienlicher
#Anwendungsbeispiele.
#
#Die indizierten sequentiellen Wortlisten der Kompaktversionen,
#--anders und meines Erachtens noch viel besser--die groﬂen
#sequentiellen Wortlisten der CD-ROM-Versionen mit der stufenweisen
#bis globalen Suche in den Wort- und Beispiellisten zunehmenden
#Umfangs, ermˆglichen eine optimale sprachliche Orientierung in einem
#umfangreichen wirtschaftlichen Sprachsschatz.
#
#Dabei sehe ich neue Wege und Mˆglichkeiten des Erwerbs und des
#Umgangs mit der Fachsprache.
#
#Wahrscheinlich bietet sich hier weit mehr als sich im ersten Eindruck
#erahnen l‰ﬂt.  Spielerisch sollte es mˆglich sein, leichter,
#schneller und intensiver zu lernen.
#
#Durch die Vielzahl der Assoziationen d¸rfte sich schneller als bisher
#eine gehobene fachsprachliche Kompetenz entwickeln.
